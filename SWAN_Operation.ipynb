    "In order to simulate a scenario, users need two important files, the bathymetry, and the command files. The bathymetry which can be understood as the computational spatial grid must be defined by the users. This also means that users can define the boundaries of the computational grid based on their interests which can be either land or water or both land and water. Figure 3 shows a common profile that can be used to simulate wave propagation from offshore to nearshore.\n",

    "        * The next \"0. 0.\" is the geographic location of the origin of the computational grid in the x- and y-axis, respectively (the default is 0.0, but users must give a value, even it is in default mode).\n",
    "        * The \"9978 0.\" is the length of the computational grid in the x- and y-axis, respectively. In the example, the length of the computational grid on the x-axis is 9978 m and on the y-axis is 0 m.\n",
    "        * The \"1000 0\" is the number of grid cells on the x-axis and y-axis. So, in the example, there is 1000 grid cell in 9978 m in the x-axis, and 0 grid cells in 0 m in the y-axis.\n",

    "    * **READINP BOTTOM 1. 'Exercise_1.bot' 1 0 FREE**: The model also requires the bathymetry files in the same directory of the input command files. Using command READINP to call the bathymetry file. In the example, the file names \"profile.bot\".\n",
    "        * **BOTTOM**: this is to define the file as bathymetry type.\n",

    "        * The \"BOUNDCOND\" (**BOU**) defines a boundary condition at the boundary. \n",

    "        * **CCW BTYPE** are clockwise and are the type of boundary condition (see User Manual for more information)\n",

    "        * **CON** the wave conditions including a constant (\"**CON**\")\n",
    "        * **PAR 2 5 0 800** the wave spectra are defined by means of the following spectral parameters with wave height as **2** m, wave period is **5** seconds. The direction of the wave is **0.0**, perpendicular to the shoreline. The coefficient of directional spreading is **800**, see Maunal.\n",
    "* ***Phisical condition***\n",
    "    * **WIND** wind speed can be put with the velocity value in x and y in m/s. In example, the wind speed in x-direction is 20 m/s.\n",

    "* ***Outputs definition***\n",
    "    * **CURVE 'profile' 0. 0. 1000 9978 0.** defines the output on a rectangular, uniform grid in a regular frame. This command has the section name as \"profile\"; frame starts at x, y = 0; the x-length = 9978 m, y-length = 0; number of points is 1000 in x-direction and 0 in y-direction.\n",
    "    * **POINTS** command defines a single output location. The users can define the coordinates of a single point or in a file with the same structure. **POINTS x y**\n",
    "* ***Write outputs***\n",
    "    * **SPEC** give the spectral density results. In the example, the spectral density is written for point 1 and point 2. The outputs will be extracted to files, for example, spectral density of point 1 will be written as \"Ex1p1.spec\"\n",
    "    * **TABLE** give the results as column for each output demand, for example wave heights or set-up. See Manual for more details. The outputs will be extracted to files, for example, wave heights along the profile will be written as \"profile.tab\"\n",
